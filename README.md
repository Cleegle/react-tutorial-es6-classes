# React Tutorial - ES6 Class Implementation

This is a React comment box example from [the React Tutorial ](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html), however it is implemented using ES6 class syntax and [superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent) instead of jQuery for ajax requests.  

I suggest reading these articles as you follow along the tutorial so that you can implement the syntax correctly.  

* [React Docs - ES6 Classes](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html#es6-classes)
* [Refactoring React Components to ES6 Classes](http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/refactoring-react-components-to-es6-classes) - you could follow the tutorial directly and then convert it using this guide
* [Why and how to bind methods in your React component classes](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/07/why-and-how-to-bind-methods-in-your-react-component-classes/) - this will help you understand why you need to bind your methods in your React classes for them to work properly
